# 🚀 Predicting Startup Success Using Machine Learning
**LSE Data Science Society Project (Autumn 2025)**  
**Project Lead:** Ariadni Papanikolaou  

---

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to build a predictive machine learning model that estimates a startup’s likelihood of success using publicly available business and funding data from Kaggle.  
By analyzing features such as founding year, total funding, location, and industry, the goal is to identify the most influential factors driving startup outcomes (success, acquisition, or closure).

**Dataset:** [Startup Success Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkc06/startup-success-prediction)  
**Source:** Kaggle (CC0 Public Domain License)

## 🧠 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess a real-world dataset of 48,000+ startups  
- Engineer and select meaningful predictive features  
- Build and evaluate classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Analyze feature importance and model interpretability (using SHAP)  
- Visualize insights through exploratory data analysis and results dashboards

## 🤝 Team Guidelines
- Work on your assigned notebook first before editing others’.  
- Always add clear commit messages.  
- If you’re unsure about GitHub, share your Colab notebook link with Ariadni to upload manually.  
- Weekly syncs will be used to review progress and merge work.
