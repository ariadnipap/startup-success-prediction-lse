## age_last_milestone_year
**Interpretation (according to Dependence Plot - See docs/tuning_results/shap_dependence_age_last_milestone_year.png):**
*(Please fill in the detailed observation here, e.g.: 'High values for this feature (red) lead to positive SHAP values, meaning that a higher value increases the likelihood of startup success.')*

## milestones
**Interpretation (according to Dependence Plot - See docs/tuning_results/shap_dependence_milestones.png):**
*(Please fill in the detailed observation here, e.g.: 'High values for this feature (red) lead to positive SHAP values, meaning that a higher value increases the likelihood of startup success.')*

## funding_total_usd
**Interpretation (according to Dependence Plot - See docs/tuning_results/shap_dependence_funding_total_usd.png):**
*(Please fill in the detailed observation here, e.g.: 'High values for this feature (red) lead to positive SHAP values, meaning that a higher value increases the likelihood of startup success.')*
